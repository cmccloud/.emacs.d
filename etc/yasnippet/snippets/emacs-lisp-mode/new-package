;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows flanges to be easily frobnicated.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; + foo
;; + bar

;; Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init
;; file:

;; (require '$1)

;;;; Usage

;; Run one of these commands:

;; $1-command: Frobnicate the flange.

;;;; Tips

;; + You can customize settings in the `$1' group.

;;;; Credits

;; This package would not have been possible without the following
;; packages: foo[1], which showed me how to bifurcate, and bar[2],
;; which takes care of flanges.
;;
;;  [1] https://example.com/foo.el
;;  [2] https://example.com/bar.el

;;;;; Keymaps

;; This technique makes it easier and less verbose to define keymaps

  ;; This makes it easy and much less verbose to define keys
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap "$1 map"))
        (maps (list

               "RET" #'$1-RET-command
               [remap search-forward] #'$1-search-forward
               )))
